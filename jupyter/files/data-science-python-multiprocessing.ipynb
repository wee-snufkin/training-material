However Python has a major limitation with the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Only one thread can be executing at once, whether it‚Äôs the main thread, or one of the others you‚Äôve spawned. So we look to alternative concurrency mechanisms like processes for sharing the load across multiple CPU cores.</p>\n<p>For <strong>threads</strong>, if you are doing ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù work like fetching data from the web where a lot of time is spent waiting for the server to respond, but very little computational work within Python is required, then threads are a great fit!</p>\n<p>However if you are doing computationally intensive work (imagine calculating prime numbers or similar complex tasks) then each thread will be contending for CPU time. Python is a single processes and can only have one thread running at a time due to the <abbr title=\"Global Interpreter Lock\">GIL</abbr>. So it will switch between multiple threads and try and make progress on each, but it cannot execute them truly simultaneously. Here we need to switch to processes.</p>\n<p><strong>Processes</strong> are relatively heavier weight as they essentially start a new python process, before executing the individual function. This is part of the reason for a ‚ÄúPool‚Äù, to amortise the expensive cost of setting up processes, before allowing them to do a lot of work quickly. Here each process can be using it‚Äôs own CPU core fully, and thus make more sense for computationally expensive tasks.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs dive straight into an example: here we‚Äôre using the <code style=\"color: inherit\">multiprocessing</code> library which uses processes and is relatively simple to understand:</p>\n",

Once each of those functions returns, then it can move on to processing the next tasks.\nThis is precisely the situation of e.g. 4 queues at the grocery; as soon as one customer is processed, they immediately begin on the next, until no more remain.</p>\n<p>You might also see a situation where the numbers are interleaved in a completely unreadable way.

Or doing some computationally expensive calculation. The last point however is especially important, as it is not always trivial to rearchitect your code to handle being spread across multiple threads or processes.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs parallelize this program which fetches some metadata from multiple Galaxy servers:</p>\n",
