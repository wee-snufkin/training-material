# Introduction

This tutorial is a follow-up to the 'Single-cell RNA-seq: Case Study' (find it [here](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/)), we will use the same sample from the previous tutorials. If you haven’t done them yet, it’s highly recommended that you go through them to get an idea how to [prepare a single cell matrix](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin/tutorial.html), [combine datasets](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin-combine-datasets/tutorial.html) or [filter, plot and process scRNA-seq data](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.html) to get the data in the form we’ll be working on today.

In this tutorial we will perform trajectory analysis using [monocle3](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/). You can find out more about the theory behind trajectory analysis here /slides/. We have already analysed the trajectory of our sample using ScanPy toolkit in another tutorial: [Trajectory Analysis using Python (Jupyter Notebook) in Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-case_JUPYTER-trajectories/tutorial.html). However, trajectory analysis is quite sensitive and some methods work better for specific datasets. Now you can go through the same steps but using a different method to compare the results, usability and the final outcome! Sounds exciting, let’s dive into that! 

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/tutorial_mode.md %}

## Get data
We still work on data from a mouse dataset of fetal growth restriction [Bacon et al. 2018](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-JUPYTER-trajectories/tutorial.html#Bacon2018) (see the study in Single Cell Expression Atlas [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/results/tsne) and the project submission [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/)), making this case study even more comprehensive. 
Monocle3 works great with annotated data, so we will make use of our annotated AnnData object, generated in the previous [tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-seq-basic-pipeline/tutorial.html#neighborhood-graph). So you see - all the hard work of processing data was not in vain! We will also need a ‘clean’ expression matrix, extracted from the AnnData object just before we started the processing.
You can find both datasets in this [input history](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/j.jakiela/h/monocle3-input-files) or download from Zenodo below.

# Preparing the input files

## Extracting annotations

 As we want to use Monocle for the trajectory analysis, we will have to feed it with cell metadata, gene annotation and expression matrix files (in theory expression matrix alone could do, but then we wouldn’t have all those useful annotations that we were working on so hard!). In order to get those files, we will extract the gene and cell annotations from our AnnData object.

Quick and easy, isn’t it? However, there are some minor changes that we have to make to our files first. 

## Cell metadata
Our current dataset is not just T-cells: as you might remember from the last tutorial, we identified a cluster of macrophages as well. This might be a problem, because the trajectory algorithm will try to find relationships between all the cells (even if they are not necessarily related!), and not only the T-cells that we are interested in. We need to remove those unwanted cell types to make the analysis more biologically relevant.

Manipulate AnnData tool allows you to filter observations or variables and that would be the easiest way to do it! However, we have to think ahead. As we want to use Monocle later on, we will have to provide it with cell metadata, gene annotation and expression matrix files anyway. This is why we extract the annotations first, make changes to them and finally we adjust the expression matrix to the filtered annotations. In that way, we’ll end up with three separate files, ready to be passed onto Monocle3.

Click on `Extracted cell annotations (obs)` file to see a small preview window. This shows you that the column containing the cell types has number 22.  We’ll need that to filter out unwanted cell types!

{: .hands_on}

## Gene annotations
Sometimes certain functionalities require specific indication where the data should be taken from. In case of Monocle3, to allow further genes analysis using one of its functions, it is essential that the names of the genes are stored in a column called ‘gene_short_name’. Therefore, we need to check what is the name of that column in our dataset.

Let’s click on the `Extracted gene annotations (var)` file to see a small preview. We can see that the gene names are in the third column with a header ‘Symbol’. Keep that in mind - we’ll use that in a second!

{: .hands_on}

## Expression matrix
Last, but not least! I would even dare to say that last, but the most important! Actually the expression matrix contains all the values representing expression level of a particular gene in a cell. This is why in theory the expression matrix is the only input file required by Monocle3 - without annotation files the CDS data can still be generated - in fact it will be quite bare, but at least it could be processed. 

So, the values in the expression matrix are just some numbers. But do you remember that we have already done some processing such as normalisation and calculation of principal components on AnnData in the previous tutorial? That affected our expression matrix. Preprocessing is one of the steps in the Monocle3 workflow, so we want to make sure that the calculations are done on a ‘clean’ expression matrix. If we apply too many operations on our raw data, it will be too ‘deformed’ to be reliable. The point of the analysis is to use algorithms that make the enormous amount of data understandable in order to draw meaningful conclusions in accordance with biology. 

So how do we do that?

{: .question}

As you can see, there are way more genes and cells in the unprocessed AnnData file, so the expression matrix is much bigger than we need it to be. If the genes and cells we prepared for Monocle3 are not the same as in the expression matrix, Monocle3 will crash. Therefore, we have to filter that big, clean matrix and adjust it to our already prepared genes and cells files. But first, let’s extract this matrix from the unprocessed AnnData object. 

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Extracting matrix

>
{: .hands_on}

If you have a look at the preview of `Unprocessed expression matrix`, you’ll see that the first column contains the cell barcodes, while the first row - the gene IDs. We would like to keep only the values corresponding to the cells and genes that are included in `Cells input data for Monocle3` and `Genes input data for Monocle3`. How do we do it? First, we compare the cell barcodes from `Cells input data for Monocle3` to those in `Unprocessed expression matrix` and ask Galaxy to keep the values of the matrix for which the barcodes in both files are the same. Then, we’ll do the same for gene IDs. So we have to cut the first columns from `Cells input data for Monocle3` and `Genes input data for Monocle3` to be able to compare those columns side by side with the matrix file.

{: .hands_on}

Look at the preview of the output file. First of all, you can see that there are 8570 lines (8569 cells) instead of 31178 cells that were present in the matrix. That’s exactly what we wanted to achieve - now we have information for the T-cells that we had filtered. However, the step that we have already performed left us with the matrix whose first and second columns are the same - let’s get rid of one of those!

> 2. **Rename** {% icon galaxy-pencil %} the output: `Filtered matrix (by cells)`
>
{: .hands_on}

Now we will perform the same steps, but for gene IDs. But gene IDs are currently in the first row, so we need to transpose the matrix, and from there we can repeat the same steps as above, but for gene IDs of course.

{% icon congratulations %} Finally! We have prepared all the files to pass them onto the Monocle3 workflow!

# Monocle3 workflow

What will happen with those files that we have been preparing so far? Well, Monocle3 turns the expression matrix, cell and gene annotations into an object called cell_data_set (CDS), which holds single-cell expression data. 

> ### {% icon details %} Details: Input files

> That’s what [Monocle3 documentation](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/docs/starting/) says about the required three input files:

>    - cell_metadata, a data frame, where rows are cells, and columns are cell attributes (such as cell type, culture condition, day captured, etc.)
>    - gene_metadata, a data frame, where rows are features (e.g. genes), and columns are gene attributes, such as biotype, gc content, etc. One of its columns should be named "gene_short_name", which represents the gene symbol or simple name (generally used for plotting) for each gene.

Here’s how the Monocle3 workflow looks like:

## Pre-processing

In Galaxy, there are currently 2 methods of initial dimensionality reduction which is included in the pre-processing step: principal component analysis (PCA) and latent semantic indexing (LSI). 
However, PCA is more commonly used, and it also allows us to perform further steps on CDS object, so we’ll use this method. There is one parameter here that has a great impact on how our analysis will look like, namely - the `dimensionality of the initially reduced space`. After many trials and errors, we were finally able to find the value that gave the best results. You can have a look at the image below to see how different values affect the outcome.

![Preprocessing num-dim](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/num_dim.png "Different outputs depending on the number of dimensions that the space was reduced to during pre-processing.")

But look - we want to infer trajectories and find relationships between cells, ideally we would see the development of cells or transition from one type to another. In the graphs where num-dim is from 10 to 200, you see that the clusters are quite disjoint, while we want to see smooth transitions from one to another. I can tell you now that we’ll go ahead with the value of **250**. We're not choosing 300, because the arrangement of the cells on that graph is not really biologically relevant.

##  Dimensionality reduction

Now it’s time for the proper dimensionality reduction so that instead of the initial thousands of dimensions, we can get only 2 and hence plot all the cells on one 2D graph. Again, there are several algorithms to do that: UMAP, tSNE, PCA and LSI (only possible when preprocess_method is set to 'LSI'), but due to the same reasons as above, we’ll use UMAP (most common + allows further operations + best results). But I’ll let you see how the output from other algorithms look to convince you that **UMAP** is indeed the best in this case. Of course it might happen that by choosing different pre-processing values, tSNE or PCA plots would look better, so don't be afriad to play around the parameters and test them!

## Plotting
 
Alright, now let's have a look at our output! Above you got a sneak peek of how the plot would look like, but now you’ll generate them on your own! 

Thanks to the fact that we provided Monocle3 with annotated data, we can now color the cells by any attribute that was in the cell metadata file! So, similarly to the previous tutorial, we’ll color them by cell type, genotype, batch and sex. At least for now.

[Previous tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.html) discussed in detail the biological interpretation of data, so we will quickly go through similar analysis to see if the results are consistent and if we can draw any new conclusions. 

As a reminder, here's the comparision between cell type annotation done in the other tutorial using Scanpy, and the output from the previous step of this tutorial. The main difference is that Scanpy was used to identify the cell types and assign them to clusters. That data was then passed on to Force-Directed + PAGA algorithms to infer trajectory, and then the arrangement of the cell groups changed a bit. In Monocle, trajectory analysis will be based on the clustering you see now. Therefore, the fact that on the Monocle plot we clearly see DN cells on one side of the graph and T-mat on the other, going through DP cells, looks promising. But there is DP-M1 group that suspiciously branches out... Let's investigate that and wait until the trajectory is inferred!

There might be indeed a bit of batch effect, so you could consider using batch correction on this dataset (you can easily do it in R, using monocle3 library!). However, if look on the other clusters, where there is batch mixing, we can still assess this biologically even without batch correction. Additionally, we will also look at the confounding effect of sex.

## Clustering

Don't get confused - we haven't clustered our cells yet, for now we have only plotted them based on cell type annotation. Now it's time for creating clusters, which - ideally - would cover the same areas as cell types. It would mean that clustering in Scanpy during previous tutorial to assign the cell types is consistent with Monocle clustering. 
>
Before inferring the trajectory, we have to group cells into clusters. Monocle uses a technique called [community detection](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z)  to group cells. This approach was introduced by [Levine et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4508757/) as part of the phenoGraph algorithm. 
>
Monocle also divides the cells into larger, more well separated groups called partitions, using a statistical test from [Alex Wolf et al](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1663-x), introduced as part of their [PAGA](https://github.com/theislab/paga) algorithm.

> ### {% icon details %} Details: Clusters vs partitions
> 
> Clusters are particularly useful while trying to assign cells to a certain type, because they are based on the similarity in gene expression. While inferring the trajectory, we will be analysing the relationships between clusters.
>
> Partitions are larger groups of cells, usually containing several clusters. Trajectory inference is performed only within one partition, so it is essential that all the cells that we want to analyse in pseudotime belong to the same partition.

If we compare the annotated cell types and the clusters that were just formed, we see that they nicely correspond to one another.

## Gene expression
> We haven't looked at gene expression yet! This step is particularly important when working with data which is not annotated. Then, based on the expression of marker genes, you are able to identify which clusters correspond to which cell types. This is indeed what we did in the previous tutorial using scanpy. We can do the same using Monocle3! Since we work on annotated data, we can directly check if the expressed genes actually correspond to the previously assigned cell types. If they do, that’s great - if two different methods are consistent, that gives us more confidence that our results are valid. 
> Below is the table that we used in the previous tutorial to identify the cell types.

| Marker | Cell type |
|--------------------|
| Il2ra    | Double negative (early T-cell)    |
| Cd8b1, Cd8a, Cd4    | Double positive (middle T-cell)|
| Cd8b1, Cd8a, Cd4 - high | Double positive (late middle T-cell)|
| Itm2a    | Mature T-cell |
| Aif1    | Macrophages    |

> Hba-a1 gene is highly expressed in a tiny bit of the middle DP cluster. Interestingly, it forms clearly visible, distinct, little branch. It means that hemoglobin - a red blood cell marker appears there, even more - those cells were gathered there. Obviously, that should NOT be found in T-cells. However, if you remember the expression of that gene in the previous tutorial where Scanpy was used (just look on the image below) - that marker appeared throughout the entire sample in low numbers. This suggests some background in the media the cells were in. Monocle allowed us to gather the cells expressing that gene into a distinct group! That's great! Thanks to that, we wouldn't have to play with filtering settings (which would be the solution in the previous tutorial and which might cause the loss of many other cells as well) - we could just remove that small group. This is just a note for the future reference - for now we'll continue with the data we already have. At least we know what this tiny branch exactly is.

## Top marker genes 

Here we used a priori knowledge regarding the marker genes. If we wanted to approach this problem in an unsupervised manner, we could use Monocle to tell us what would be the top marker genes in each group of cells. This is very useful if we don’t know the type of the cells in a specific cluster and we want to identify it, based on common marker genes. Or when we want to find other marker genes than those currently known.

The table output is quite self-explanatory and it's useful to get details about the top marker genes in each cluster. Another output visually presents what how different genes are expressed across all the clusters, which is a good overiew of gene expression over the whole sample.

There is also one more tool that allows you to get a better insight into gene expression, namely - identifying differentially expressed genes along the inferred trajectory. But in order to do that, we have to infer that trajectory first!

## Learn the trajectory graph

We’re getting closer and closer! The next step is to learn the trajectory graph, which means to fit a principal graph within each partition. In that way, we’ll ‘connect’ the existing clusters by creating a path between them.

As you can see, the learned trajectory path is just a line connecting the clusters. However, there are some important points to understand here. 
> If the resolution of the clusters is high, then the trajectory path will be very meticulous, strongly branched and curved. There's a danger here that we might start seeing things that don't really exist.
> You can set an option to learn a single tree structure for all the partitions or use the partitions calculated when clustering and identify disjoint graphs in each. To make the right decision, you have to understand how/if the partitions are related and what would make more biolgical sense. In our case, we were only interested in a big partition containing all the cells and we ignored the small 'dot' classified as another partition. Hence, we didn't want to make connections between those partitions via trajectory path. 
> There are many trajectory patterns: linear, cycle, bifurcation, tree and so on. Those patterns might correspond to various biological processes: transition events for different phases, cell cycle, cell differentiation. Therefore, branching points are quite important on the trajectory path. You can always plot them, checking the right box in {% tool Monocle3 plotCells %}.


![learned graph](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/learned_trajectory.png "Learned trajectory path")

## Pseudotime analysis

Finally it's time to see our cells in pseudotime! We have already learned trajectory, now we only have to order cells along it. Monocle3 requires information where to start ordering the cells, so we need to provide it with this information. We annotated early T-cells as double negative (DN), so those will be our root cells! 

> ### {% icon details %} Details: Pseudotime

> To infer trajectories, we need data from cells at different points along a path of differentiation. This inferred temporal dimension is known as pseudotime. Pseudotime measures the cells’ progress through the transition.

Now we can see how all those things that we were working on come together to give a final pseudotime trajectory analysis. DN cells gently switching to DP-M which change into DP-L to finally become mature T-cells. Isn't it beautiful? But wait, don't be too enthusiastic - why on earth DP-M1 group branches out? We didn't expect that... 
>
By using the gene expression plots we made sure that `Itm2a` gene is not expressed in the DP-M1 cluster, so it is not mature T-cells. Interestingly, also genes `Cd8b1, Cd8a, Cd4` are not expressed in DP-M1 as significantly as in other DP-M clusters. We also checked top markers for DP-M1 and discovered that most of them are just ribosomal. Those cells might be maturing, but we’re not certain why they don’t go into the Itm2a group, so maybe there’s a trajectory we don’t know about? 
> 
There are a lot of such questions in bioinformatics and we're always get excited when we try to answer them, hoping that we will be able to make a groundbreaking discovery. However, with analysing scRNA-seq data, it's almost like you need to know about 75% of your data and make sure your analysis shows that, for you to then identify the 25% new information. Additionally, pseudotime analysis crucially depends on choosing the right analysis and parameter values, as we showed for example with initial dimentionality reduction during pre-processing. It also requires a understanding of the underlying biology (we have to choose the root cells, for instance, or recognise when certain cell arrangements don't make sense). The mysterious branching of DP-M1 is a great example how cautious you must be during scRNA-seq data analysis (particularly trajectory analysis) and check it with the biological knowledge - this branching might be just a misleading algorithm's anomaly or something new, still undiscovered! 


![pseudotime](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/pseudotime.png "Trajectory analysis - pseudotime")

Once the trajectory has been inferred, you might want to return to the gene expression analysis and dive into that in more depth. Here is a powerful tool that would give you even more information about the genes.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

{% icon congratulations %} Well done, you’ve made it to the end! You might want to consult your results with this [control history](), or check out the [full workflow]() for this tutorial. I also split this workflow into two separate workflows: [preparing the input files for Monocle3, starting from AnnData](), and [Monocle3 only workflow](). You can use them to accelerate analysis of your own data, paying attention to the requirements of the input data, mentioned in this tutorial.

In this tutorial, you moved from technical processing to biological exploration. By analysing real data - both the exciting and the messy! - you have, hopefully, experienced what it’s like to analyse and question a dataset, potentially without clear cut-offs or clear answers. If you were working in a group, you each analysed the data in different ways, and most likely found similar insights. One of the biggest problems in analysing scRNA-seq is the lack of a clearly defined pathway or parameters. You have to make the best call you can as you move through your analysis, and ultimately, when in doubt, try it multiple ways and see what happens!
