title: Data management in Medicinal Chemistry

zenodo_link: ''

questions:
- Why does the medicinal chemistry research produce so much data?
- How can big data be useful for medicinal chemists?
- What are the current publicly available databases that can be used for drug discovery and development?

objectives:
- Learn some terminology from the field of medicinal chemistry
- Understand the idea of data-driven medicinal chemistry
- Explore the databases used for drug discovery and development

time_estimation: 1H

key_points:
- The power of big data might be useful to shape innovations of the future in the pharmaceutical field.
- There are many publicly available databases used for drug discovery and development and they might look at the same medicines from different angles and classify them based on various factors.
