# Introduction 
The development of medicinal chemistry is more and more advancing. Big pharmaceutical companies, research institutes and universities are working on ground-breaking solutions to help patients combat all kinds of diseases. During that development process, tons of data are generated – not only from the lab environment but also from clinical trials. Given that the discovery of more potent, safer and cheaper drugs is the ultimate goal of all research bodies, we should all focus on making the data we gather FAIR: **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable to push the boundaries of drug development even further. 

With the currently available methods such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, many toolkits, software and access to various databases, managing big data is now inherently linked to medicinal chemistry and helps to make this area as efficient as it can be. 


# Principles of medicinal chemistry research

## Drug-likeness
There are many factors that medicinal chemists take into account while designing new drugs. It is essential to estimate the properties of the molecule before syntesisng it in the lab, so the structures of drug candidates are usually compared to the existing drugs by so-called drug-likeness. This includes intrinsic properties of a compound that will lead to favourable ADMET (**A**bsorption, **D**istribution, **M**etabolism, **E**xcretion, **T**oxicity) characteristics. Below are some properties usually assessed:
- Lipophilicity
- Size
- Polarity
- Insolubility
- Insaturation
- Flexibility

Additionally, there have been some rules developed to help estimate drug-likeness, amongst which:
- Lipinski rule ({% cite Lipinski2001 %})
- Ghose rule ({% cite Ghose1999 %})
- Veber rule ({% cite Veber2002 %})
- Egan rule ({% cite Egan2000 %})
- Muegge rule ({% cite Muegge2001 %})
- Abbott bioavailability score ({% cite Martin2005 %})


As you see, the number of characteristics to consider before even synthesising the molecule is huge. One of the tools that helps to summarise all the most important information about intrinsic properties and drug-likeness of compounds is called [SwissADME](http://www.swissadme.ch/) and is a free web tool to evaluate pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness and medicinal chemistry friendliness of small molecules ({% cite Daina2017 %}). 

Below we briefly discuss two probably the most well-known rules: Lipinski's and Veber's.

## The Lipinski rule of 5

The rule of thumb developed back in 1997 by Christopher Lipinski and colleagues tries to predict the likelihood that a given small molecule can be orally active. This Lipinski rule of 5 favours molecules as potential oral drug candidates if:
-	The molecular mass is less than 500
-	calculated logarithm of the octanol−water partition coefficient (clogP) is less than 5
-	they have up to 5 H-bond donors
-	they have up to 10 H-bond acceptors

Read more about re-assessing the rule of 5: {% cite Mullard2018 %}.

However, nowadays there are more and more drugs being developed which don’t comply with those rules and regardless are still effective. There are voices from the scientific community, pointing out that “We are in danger of repeating our past mistakes if we assume these new modalities are not 'drug-like' and cannot be oral drugs because they are not [rule of 5] compliant” (Michael Shultz from Novartis {% cite Mullard2018 %}). Then, in {% cite OHagan2014 %} we read "This famous "rule of 5" has been highly influential in this regard, but only about 50 % of orally administered new chemical entities actually obey it." 


## Veber's rule

In addition to the rule of 5, there are also other criteria, one of which is the Veber's rule, which helps to predict good oral bioavailability based on:
- 10 or fewer rotatable bonds
- Polar surface area no greater than 140 Å <sup>2</sup>


# Big data for drug discovery

Have you ever wondered how new drugs are developed? It is actually quite a long and complex pathway and not only takes lots of time, but also resources. The scheme below will help you understand the scale of that process.

![A scheme showing drug discovery pipeline: starting from target identification, hit, lead, lead optimisation, pre-clinical testing, clinical evaluation in phases I - III, and finaly regulatory approval. Lead optimisation also includes iterative steps of designing, making, testing and analysing the proposed compounds.](../../images/X.png "A scheme showing drug discovery pipeline")

As you can see, to get just one drug to the market, often thousands of structures are assessed to find the most effective and safe compound. That's lots of information being generated in the whole process! The information can be stored in repositories and databases so that subsequent drug discovery process in a similar area is easier, faster and cheaper. Managing big data and using machine learning and computational chemistry methods is crucial in lead optimisation step. By reviewing chemical databases and studying molecular docking simulations, we can save much time and resources to synthesise only those compounds that are the most promising based on *in-silico* methods. Even after synthesising the optimised 'leads', we still get lots of data from tests and analyses. By using appropriate cheminformatic tools and software, we can use the results to drive forward this iterative process of lead optimisation.


## Ten Vs of big data for drug discovery

Hopefully now you have an idea of how the process of drug discovery looks like. To understand why managing data in medicinal chemistry is so challanging, let's have a closer look at "Ten Vs" {% cite Zhao2020 %} of big data:

- **V**olume: size of data. 
- **V**elocity: speed of new data generation. 
- **V**ariety: various formats of data. 
- **V**eracity: quality of data. 
- **V**alidity: authenticity of data. 
- **V**ocabulary: terminology of data. 
- **V**enue: platform of data generation. 
- **V**isualization: view of data. 
- **V**olatility: duration of data usefulness. 
- **V**alue: potential of data usefulness to reduce the cost of drug discovery and development.

It is important that medicinal chemists keep in mind those features while both searching for data and publishing it. In this way we can focus on the main aspects of data management, try to improve the availability and normalisation of data, and be aware of limitations of repositories and inconsistencies in data quality. 

## FAIR MedChem
Those are the properties that the compounds can be easily searched by if all the information is included in the database. There is a need of assessing other molecular properties. This is one of the reasons why new repositories are being developed – they are more specific and gather particular properties of interest [EXAMPLE?]. 
How much easier the life of scientists could be if the relevant data was publicly available, well-ordered and contained the needed metadata? By submitting the data with necessary information to the repository is a good way to make the data FAIR. This will make it:
- **F**indable, as the data will be given specific identifiers
- **A**ccessible, as the data will be available online, open and free where possible
-	**I**nteroperable, as the repository will often enforce the use of formalised, consistent language
-	**R**eusable, as the data will be released under a license with detailed provenance
In the repositories 


# Chemical and pharmacological databases

Currently there are lots of publicly available databases storing information about hit molecules, chemical structures and properties, drug targets, pharmaceuticals… In the recent paper {% cite Zhao2020 %} the authors collated relevant databases to advance computer-aided drug discovery and divided them into several main groups:
- Chemical collections
- Drug / drug-like compounds
- Drug targets, including genomics and proteomics data
- Biological data from assay screening, metabolism, efficacy studies
- Drug liabilities and toxicities
- Clinical databases

Below you will find the databases listed under corresponding categoories, all taken from {% cite Zhao2020 %} paper. 

There are many more databases available, and many are still being developed. They are often quite specific and contain certain types of compounds (eg. PROTACS) or are aimed at particular disease. If the listed databases are not specific enough for your research, you can try luck by searching smaller, more specific databases.

# Data management in chemistry using Galaxy

## Chemical file formats

Depending on the type of analysis you are going to perform, you will work with different file formats. Below are the most important data types, commonly used in cheminformatics, that you will likely see in Galaxy:
- SDF (.sd, .sdf) - stands for Structure-Data Format, and SDF files actually wrap the molfile (MDL Molfile) format. Stores information about the chemical structure and associated data of compounds in plain text. Files in SDF format can encode single or multiple molecules that are then delimited by lines consisting of four dollar signs ($$$$). SDF files are formatted ASCII files that store information about the positions of the individual atoms (either in 2D or 3D space) that make up the molecule. The data on connectivity and hybridization state are also encoded, although their use is less frequent and often inconsistent.
- MOL (.mol) - an MDL Molfile for holding information about the atoms, bonds, connectivity and coordinates of a molecule. 
- MOL2 (.mol2) - a Tripos Mol2 file is a complete, portable representation of a SYBYL molecule. It is an ASCII file which contains all the information needed to
reconstruct a SYBYL molecule
- CML (.cml) - Chemical Markup Language (ChemML or CML) is an approach to managing molecular information using tools such as XML and Java. It supports a wide range of chemical concepts including: molecules, reactions, spectra and analytical data, computational chemistry, chemical crystallography and materials
- InChI (IUPAC International Chemical Identifier) - a textual identifier for chemical substances, designed to provide a standard way to encode molecular information. The identifiers describe chemical substances in terms of layers of information — the atoms and their bond connectivity, tautomeric information, isotope information, stereochemistry, and electronic charge information ({% cite Heller2015 %})
- SMILES (.smi) - the **s**implified **m**olecular-**i**nput **l**ine-**e**ntry **s**ystem (SMILES) is a specification in the form of a line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings. A linear text format which can describe the connectivity and chirality of a molecule ({% cite Weininger1988 %}) 
- PDB - the Protein Data Bank (PDB) file format is a textual file format describing the three-dimensional structures of molecules held in the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/), now succeeded by the mmCIF format. It contains description and annotation of protein and nucleic acid structures including atomic coordinates, secondary structure assignments, as well as atomic connectivity. In addition experimental metadata is stored. ({% cite Berman2007 %})
- GRO (.gro) - a plain text file storing spatial coordinates and velocities (if available) of atoms during a molecular dynamics simulation, utilised by [GROMACS](https://manual.gromacs.org/archive/5.0.3/online/gro.html)

If you plan to work with molecular dynamics simulations, there are also some MD trajectory file formats that you might want to get familiar with. In Galaxy, you can convert between  xtc, trr, dcd and netcdf files using a tool called {% tool [MDTraj file converter](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/chemteam/md_converter/md_converter/1.9.6+galaxy0) %}.

## Galaxy tools 

In Galaxy Chemical Toolbox there are dozens of tools that can be used for various analyses. Below we will only show a few, mostly related to data import, format conversion and some functions linked to what was discussed previously. 

Let's start with importing publicly available data. [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) stores tons of three-dimensional structural data of proteins nucleic acids and other biological molecules.

> <hands-on-title>Import PDB file from Protein Data Bank</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Open [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/)
> 2. Type your search term in the box *"Enter search term(s), Entry ID(s), or sequence"*: `MAO B`
> ![A screenshot showing a search box in the upper right corner of the Protein Data Bank website.](../../images/pdb_search.jpg "Search box of the Protein Data Bank")
> 3. Choose the structure of interest and copy its accession code: 2BK3
> ![A screenshot showing some of the resulting structures with their accession codes.](../../images/pdb_results.jpg "How to get accession code of the resulting structures.")
> 4. Switch to Galaxy
> 5. {% tool [Get PDB file](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/get_pdb/get_pdb/0.1.0) %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"PDB accession code"*: `2BK3`
>
{: .hands_on}

This is often the first step of docking studies that you can learn about in other tutorials, for example in [Protein-ligand docking tutorial]({% link topics/computational-chemistry/tutorials/cheminformatics/tutorial.md %}).

You can import any molecule to Galaxy using SMILES notation. Below it's an example on benzenesulfonyl chloride and ethylamine. 

> <hands-on-title>Import SMILES</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Copy SMILES of your molecule(s) of interest. In this example we use benzenesulfonyl chloride (SMILES: C1=CC=C(C=C1)S(=O)(=O)Cl) and ethylamine (SMILES: CCN).
> 2. Click on **" {% icon galaxy-upload %} Upload data"** button in the tools panel on the left hand side.
> 3. Click on **" {% icon galaxy-wf-edit %} Paste/Fetch data"** button twice. Two boxes will appear.
> 4. In the first box, under **"Name"** section, enter `Benzenesulfonyl chloride` and under **"Type"**: `smi`
> 5. Below paste the SMILES of benzenesulfonyl chloride: `C1=CC=C(C=C1)S(=O)(=O)Cl`
> 6. In the second box, under **"Name"** section, enter `Ethylamine` and under **"Type"**: `smi`
> 7. Below paste the SMILES of ethylamine: `CCN`
> 8. Click **"Start"** button, then close the dialog box. Your files are being added to your history!
>    
{: .hands_on}

As you learned from the previous section, there are many different formats used in computational chemistry. Of course, Galaxy allows you to interconvert betweeen them - just have a look below!

> <hands-on-title>Convert the file format</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Compound conversion](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/openbabel_compound_convert/openbabel_compound_convert/3.1.1+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-files %} *"Molecular input file"*: click on {% icon param-files %} *Multiple datasets* icon and choose both `Benzenesulfonyl chloride` and `Ethylamine`
>    - *"Output format"* - you have many options to choose from! Not only the formats but also the associated parameters. Just scroll the list and pick the one that is relevant to your downstream analysis. Here we use `MDL MOL format (sdf, mol)`
> 2. Rename {% icon galaxy-pencil %} the corresponding files `Benzenesulfonyl chloride SDF` and `Ethylamine SDF`. Make sure to check either the starting dataset numbers or the atoms in the file in order not to confuse the two files! 
>
{: .hands_on}

We intentionally chose to work on benzenesulfonyl chloride and ethylamine. Do you know why? Well, if you think about the synthesis of sulfonamides, that's exactly what you need - a sulfonyl chloride and an amine. So... let's do some computational synthesis! 

> <hands-on-title>Run the reaction</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Reaction maker](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/ctb_im_rxn_maker/ctb_im_rxn_maker/1.1.4+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Input file"*: `Benzenesulfonyl chloride SDF`
>    - *"Reagent options"*: Sulfonamide
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Reagent file"*: `Ethylamine SDF`
>
{: .hands_on}

> <tip-title> {% icon tool %} **Reaction maker** works also with SMILES!</tip-title>
>
> Above we converted the *.smi* file into *.sdf* to show how {% icon tool %} **Compound conversion** tool works. However, it is worth pointing out that {% icon tool %} **Reaction maker** works also with SMILES files and the conversion happens automaticaly so that your *.smi* dataset is imported as *.sdf* input.
>
{: .tip} 

> <details-title>Which reations I can run using this tool?</details-title>
>
> {% icon tool %} **Reaction maker** works with more reaction types, such as:
> - Amides synthesis
> - Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr mechanism)
> - Urea
> - Suzuki coupling
> - Sulfonamide
> - Reductive amination

The output is the *.txt* logfile and the SDF file with the product molecule. If you have a look at that file, you'll see that there is just a list of atoms with their corresponding coordinates. To draw the resulting structure, we can use another tool.

Since we spoke about the drug-likeness in the previous section, let's see how it works in practice, on the example of our "synthesised" molecule.

>    - *"Method"* - two possible methods to weight the features are available - one based on max. weight (QEDw,max), the other on mean weight (QEDw,mo). There is also an option to leave features unweighted (QEDw,u) and we'll choose this one: `unweighted (QEDw,u)`

In medicinal chemistry we often base the new structures on scaffolds of existing drugs. Therefore, it is quite useful to be able to find similar structures - below is an example how to do it in Galaxy.

> 1. {% tool [Search ChEMBL database](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/chembl/chembl/0.10.1+galaxy4) %} with the following parameters:

>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Input file"*: `Benzenesulfonyl chloride`
>    - *"Search type"*: `Substructure`

Let's repeat this step, but with applying Lipinski's Rule of Five that you learned about in the previous section of this tutorial!

> 2. You will be redirected to {% tool [Search ChEMBL database](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/chembl/chembl/0.10.1+galaxy4) %}. Leave all the parameters as before, except for one:
>    - *"Filter for Lipinski's Rule of Five"*: {% icon param-toggle %} `Yes`
> 2. Rename {% icon galaxy-pencil %} the output file `Benzenesulfonyl chloride Lipinski substructures`
