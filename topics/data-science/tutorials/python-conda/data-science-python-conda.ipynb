This means\nthat you will have to use a <em>package manager</em> tool to install them on your system.</p>\n<p>Applications will also sometimes need a\nspecific version of an external library (e.g. because they require that a particular\nbug has been fixed in a newer version of the library), or a specific version of Python interpreter.\nThis means that each Python application you work with may require a different setup and a set of dependencies so it\nis important to be able to keep these configurations separate to avoid confusion between projects.\nThe solution for this problem is to create a self-contained\n<em>environment</em> per project, which contains a particular version of Python installation plus a number of\nadditional external libraries.</p>\n<p>If you see something like</p>\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div><pre style=\"color: inherit; background: transparent\"><code style=\"color: inherit\"><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">pysam</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>You know you’ll need additional packages installed on your system, as it relies on <a href=\"https://github.com/samtools/htslib\">htslib, a C library for working with HTS data</a>. This usually means installing additional packages and things that are not always available from within Python’s packaging ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Conda environments go beyond virtual environments, and make it easier to develop, run, test and share code with others. In this tutorial, we learn how\nto set up an environment to develop our code and manage our external dependencies.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"agenda\" style=\"border: 2px solid #86D486;display: none; margin: 1em 0.2em\">\n<div class=\"box-title agenda-title\" id=\"agenda\">Agenda</div>\n<p>In this tutorial, we will cover:</p>\n<ol id=\"markdown-toc\">\n<li><a href=\"#conda-environments\" id=\"markdown-toc-conda-environments\">Conda Environments</a></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"conda-environments\">Conda Environments</h2>\n<p>So what exactly are conda environments, and why use them?</p>\n<p>A conda environment is an <strong>isolated working copy</strong> of specific versions of\none of more packages and all of their dependencies.</p>\n<p>This is in fact simply a <em>directory with a particular structure</em> which includes\nlinks to and enables multiple side-by-side installations of different packages\nor different versions of the same external library to coexist on your machine\nand only one to be selected for each of our projects. This allows you to work on\na particular project without worrying about affecting other projects on your\nmachine.</p>\n<p>As more external libraries are added to your project over time, you can add them to\nits specific environment and avoid a great deal of confusion by having separate (smaller) environments\nfor each project rather than one huge global environment with potential package version clashes. Another big motivator\nfor using environments is that they make sharing your code with others much easier (as we will see shortly).\nHere are some typical scenarios where the usage of environments is highly recommended (almost unavoidable):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have two dependencies with conflicting dependencies! You cannot install\nthe specific version of software X alongside software Y, as they both depend\non different versions of a dependency, that cannot co-exist. This is solved by\nhaving different environments for both.</li>\n<li>You have an older project that only works under Python 2. You do not have the time to migrate the project to Python 3\nor it may not even be possible as some of the third party dependencies are not available under Python 3. You have to\nstart another project under Python 3. The best way to do this on a single machine is to set up two separate Python\nenvironments.</li>\n<li>One of your Python 3 projects is locked to use a particular older version of a third party dependency. You cannot use the\nlatest version of the\ndependency as it breaks things in your project. In a separate branch of your project, you want to try and fix problems\nintroduced by the new version of the dependency without affecting the working version of your project. You need to set up\na separate conda environments for your branch to ‘isolate’ your code while testing the new feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You do not have to worry too much about specific versions of external libraries that your project depends on most of the time.\nConda environments enable you to always use the latest available version without specifying it explicitly.\nThey also enable you to use a specific older version of a package for your project, should you need to.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"tip\" style=\"border: 2px solid #FFE19E; margin: 1em 0.2em\">\n<div class=\"box-title tip-title\" id=\"tip-a-specific-package-version-is-only-ever-installed-once\"><button class=\"gtn-boxify-button tip\" type=\"button\" aria-controls=\"tip-a-specific-package-version-is-only-ever-installed-once\" aria-expanded=\"true\"><i class=\"far fa-lightbulb\" aria-hidden=\"true\" ></i> Tip: A Specific Package Version is Only Ever Installed Once<span class=\"fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square\"></span></button></div>\n<p>Note that you will not have a separate package installations for each of your projects - they will only\never be installed once on your system (in <code style=\"color: inherit\">&#36;CONDA/pkgs</code>) but will be referenced from different environments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"managing-conda-environments\">Managing Conda Environments</h3>\n<p>There are several commonly used command line tools for managing environments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code style=\"color: inherit\">homebrew</code>, historically used on OSX to manage packages.</li>\n<li><code style=\"color: inherit\">nix</code>, which has a steep learning curve but allows you to declare the state of your entire system</li>\n<li><code style=\"color: inherit\">conda</code>, package and environment management system (also included as part of the Anaconda Python distribution often used by the scientific community)</li>\n<li><code style=\"color: inherit\">docker</code> and <code style=\"color: inherit\">singularity</code> are somewhat similar to other environment managers, as they can have isolated images with software and dependencies.</li>\n<li>Other, language specific managers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While there are pros and cons for using each of the above, all will do the job of managing\nenvironments for you and it may be a matter of personal preference which one you go for. The Galaxy project is heavily invested in the Conda ecosystem and recommends it as an entry point as it is the most generally useful, and convenient. <a href=\"http://bioconda.github.io/\">The BioConda ecosystem</a> provides an unbelievably large number of packages for bioinformatics specific purposes, which makes it a good choice in general.</p>\n<h3 id=\"managing-packages\">Managing Packages</h3>\n<p>Part of managing your (virtual) working environment involves installing, updating and removing external packages\non your system. The Conda command (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">conda</code>) is most commonly used for this - it interacts\n and obtains the packages from one or more Conda repositories (e.g. Conda Forge, BioConda, etc.)</p>\n<blockquote class=\"tip\" style=\"border: 2px solid #FFE19E; margin: 1em 0.2em\">\n<div class=\"box-title tip-title\" id=\"tip-a-note-on-anaconda-and-code-style-quot-color-inherit-quot-conda-code\"><button class=\"gtn-boxify-button tip\" type=\"button\" aria-controls=\"tip-a-note-on-anaconda-and-code-style-quot-color-inherit-quot-conda-code\" aria-expanded=\"true\"><i class=\"far fa-lightbulb\" aria-hidden=\"true\" ></i> Tip: A Note on Anaconda and <code style=&quot;color: inherit&quot;>conda</code><span class=\"fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square\"></span></button></div>\n<p>Anaconda is an open source Python\ndistribution commonly used for scientific programming - it conveniently installs Python, package and environment management <code style=\"color: inherit\">conda</code>, and a\nnumber of commonly used scientific computing packages so you do not have to obtain them separately.\n<code style=\"color: inherit\">conda</code> is an independent command line tool (available separately from the Anaconda distribution too) with dual functionality: (1) it is a package manager that helps you find Python packages from\nremote package repositories and install them on your system, and (2) it is also a virtual environment manager. So, you can use <code style=\"color: inherit\">conda</code> for both tasks instead of using <code style=\"color: inherit\">venv</code> and <code style=\"color: inherit\">pip</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code style=\"color: inherit\">venv</code> and <code style=\"color: inherit\">pip</code> are considered the <em>de facto</em> standards for environment and package management for Python 3.\nHowever, the advantages of using Anaconda and <code style=\"color: inherit\">conda</code> are that you get (most of the) packages needed for\nscientific code development included with the distribution. If you are only collaborating with others who are also using\nAnaconda, you may find that <code style=\"color: inherit\">conda</code> satisfies all your needs.</p>\n<p>It is good, however, to be aware of all these tools (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip</code>, <code style=\"color: inherit\">venv</code>, <code style=\"color: inherit\">pyenv</code>, etc.),\nand use them accordingly. As you become more familiar with them you will realise that equivalent tools work in a similar\nway even though the command syntax may be different (and that there are equivalent tools for other programming languages\ntoo to which your knowledge can be ported).</p>\n<figure id=\"figure-1\" style=\"max-width: 90%; margin:auto;\"><img src=\"../../images/xkcd/python_environment.png\" alt=\"Python environment hell XKCD comic  showing boxes like pip, easy_install, homebrew 2.7, anaconda, homebrew 3.6, /usr/local/Cellar, ~/python/, and a chaotic mess of arrows moving between them all.

        "- Use `conda create -n <name>` to create and manage environments.\n",
        "- Use `conda install` to install and manage additional external (third-party) libraries.\n",
        "- Conda allows you to declare all dependencies for a project in a separate file (by convention called `environment.yml`) which can be shared with collaborators/users and used to replicate an environment.\n",
        "- Use `conda env export > environment.yml` to take snapshot of your project's dependencies.\n",
        "- Use `conda env create -f environment.yml` to replicate someone else's environment on your machine from the `environment.yml` file.\n",
