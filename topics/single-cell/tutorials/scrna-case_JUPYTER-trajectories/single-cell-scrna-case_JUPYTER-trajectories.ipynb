Watch this space for a fix!</p>\n<p>Well arenâ€™t those charts interesting! Using the diffusion map to drive the force-directed graph, we see correct ordering of our cells (from DN to DP to T-mature, which was lost with the diffusion map alone) as well as two apparent branches leaving the mature T-cell population, which is what weâ€™d biologically expect. In terms of our experiment, weâ€™re seeing a clear trajectory issue whereby the knockout cells are not found along the trajectory into T-mature (which, well, we kind of already figured out with just the cluster analysis, but we can feel even more confident about our results!) More importantly, we can see the T-mature population dividing itself, which we did not see in the clustering via UMAP/tSNE alone, and we can verify that as the leftmost branch has CD4 but the rightmost branch does not. This is suggesting our branchpoint from to CD4+ and CD8+ single positive cells. Exciting! However, it is important to note, that the branches there are quite small and sparsely populated, which can indicate artifact branches (i.e. trajectory analysis does its best to find branches, particularly diffusion map, so you can pretty easily force branches to appear even if they are not biologically real!). However, to be frank, we were surprised not to find this clearer in the main cluster map, as we know that the T-cells should diverge at that point, so if anything this is a relief that our data is believable!</p>\n<p>And now, just for fun, we can compare the scatter graph with our PAGA side by side.</p>\n",

With single-cell, the more ways you can prove to yourself what youâ€™re seeing is real, the better! If we did not find consistent results, we would need to delve in further to see if the algorithm (not all algorithms fit all data!) or the biology.</p>\n<p>Where might we go from here? We might consider playing with our louvain resolutions, to get the two branches to be called as different clusters, and then comparing them to each other for gene differences or genotype differences. We might also use different objects (for instance, what if we regressed out cell cycle genes?) and see if that changes the results. Perhaps we would eliminate the DN double-branch input. Or perhaps thatâ€™s real, and we should investigate that. What would you do?</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-in-a-group-the-finale\">Working in a group? The finale!</h2>\n<p>Look at each others images! How do yours differ, what decisions were made? Previously, when calling clusters in the â€˜Filter, Plot and Explore Single-cell RNA-seq Dataâ€™, the interpretation at the end is largely consistent, no matter what decisions are made throughout (mostly!). Is this the case with your trajectory analyses? You may find that it is not, which is why pseudotime analysis even more crucially depends on your understanding of the underlying biology (we have to choose the root cells, for instance, or recognise that DN cells should not be found in the middle of the DPs) as well as choosing the right analysis. Thatâ€™s why it is a huge field! With analysing scRNA-seq data, itâ€™s almost like you need to know about 75% of your data and make sure your analysis shows that, for you to then identify the 25% new information.</p>\n<h1 id=\"export-your-data-figures-and-notebook\">Export your data, figures, and notebook</h1>\n<p>Itâ€™s now time to export your data!

You found an alternative to PCA (diffusion map), an alternative to tSNE (force-directed graph), a means of identifying cluster relationships (PAGA), and a metric for pseudotime (diffusion pseudotime) to identify early and late cells. If you were working in a group, you found that such analysis is slightly more sensitive to your decisions than the simpler filtering/plotting/clustering is. We are inferring and assuming relationships and time, so that makes sense!</p>\n<p>To discuss with like-minded scientists, join our <a href=\"https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/galaxy-single-cell?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge\">Gitter</a> channel for all things Galaxy-single cell!</p>\n",
