title: RMarkdown & RStudio

> As monocle3 is originally written in R, you can follow this tutorial simply by copying and pasting code from the GTN, but to make things easier, you can use the RMarkdown Notebook instead to be able to run the code directly as it was written, inside RStudio! This is recommended for users working locally in RStudio due to installation errors that might appear, but our interactive tools allow you to launch RStudio in Galaxy as well.

Simply go to the `Supporting Materials` section in the Overview box at the very beginning of this tutorial and click on `RMarkdown Notebook`. It will be downloaded to your computer as `single-cell-scrna-case_monocle3-rstudio.Rmd` file.

> Now you just have to open the notebook in RStudio.
