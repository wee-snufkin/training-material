    "Trace the values taken on by a loop variable during execution of the loop.",
    "Explain the difference between a variable's name and its value.",
    "Explain why spaces and some punctuation characters shouldn't be used in file names.",
    "Demonstrate how to see what commands have recently been executed.",
    "Re-run recently executed commands without retyping them.",
    "Use `grep` to select lines from text files that match simple patterns.",
    "Use `find` to find files and directories whose names match simple patterns.",
    "Use the output of one command as the command-line argument(s) to another command.",
    "Explain what is meant by 'text' and 'binary' files, and why many common tools don't handle the latter well."

  "time_estimation": "2H",
  "key_points": [
    "`wc` counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs.",
    "`cat` displays the contents of its inputs.",
    "`sort` sorts its inputs.",

    "`tail` displays the last 10 lines of its input.",
    "`command > [file]` redirects a command's output to a file (overwriting any existing content).",

    "A `for` loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list.",
    "Every `for` loop needs a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on.",
    "Use `$name` to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). `${name}` can also be used.",
    "Do not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as '*' or '?' in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion.",
    "Give files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping.",
    "Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them.",
    "Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to search through the previously entered commands.",

    "`find` finds files with specific properties that match patterns.",
