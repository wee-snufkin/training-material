The GTN has you covered with the Pan-Galactic Tool Search that is now available.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: the authors were reminded of
<a href="https://galaxycat.france-bioinformatique.fr/">GalaxyCat</a> which does the same
thing as the GTN but better! Please go use that.</p>

<hr />

<p>We recently received a question online from our colleague <a href="https://github.com/scottcain">Dr. Scott Cain</a>
trying to find the <em>Manta</em> Structural Variant analysis tool amongst the Galaxies. While
his complaints about generic names are very apt (and Galaxy existed before the
phone!) we do still have very generic names in our tools.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is also quite difficult with these large, complex,
JavaScript based web applications. So, the GTN has added a Pan Galactic Tool
Search!</p>

<iframe src="https://genomic.social/@scottcain/110498601155255378/embed" width="100%" height="250">
Scott: Arg! Please don't use common words to name your software projects! First (and a long time ago) you have the fine folks @galaxyproject using that word, then you have the SV caller Manta, making it impossible to answer with a simple google whether manta is available at a public Galaxy hub.
</iframe>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h2>

<p>The GTN uses the list of <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/use/">Public Galaxy
Servers</a> available from the Hub to construct
the dropdowns you see on Tutorials indicating which servers support a given
tutorial.</p>

<p>Every time the GTN gets deployed (at minimum once a day), we collect a list of
tools that are available from each of those servers. This metadata is available
directly from the GTN (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/api/psl.json</code>).</p>

<p>When we render a tutorial, we check the list of tools used in that tutorial,
both those annotated by authors, as well as whichever ones are mentioned in the
associated workflows, and list the intersection of what’s available.</p>

<p>Since we had this metadata already available, it was trivial to generate a tool
search which simply searches through this file and lists the relevant servers.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>As the GTN is a static site, so is our search. It takes a second to load the
tool search interface (~7MB uncompressed), but after that you can search more
or less instantaneously through all 15k versions of the 6k known tools we see
across the Galaxy.</p>]]></content><author><name>Helena Rasche</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new feature" /><category term="gtn" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you ever want to run a tool, but not know where it might be available?

We have automatically activated the new Progress Pride theme on the home page (<a href="#" onclick="setTheme('progress')">Click to Activate</a>) if you hadn’t already selected a theme.</p>

<p>This month we want to highlight the contributions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_L._Hart">Alan L. Hart</a>, an American physician and radiologist who pioneered the use of X-Rays to screen for Tuberculosis. Dr. Hart was one of the first trans men to have a hysterectomy in the US.</p>

<h2 id="tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</h2>

<p>Tuberculosis, mostly caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"><em>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis</em></a>, is 13<sup>th</sup> leading cause of death. It was temporarily decreased to the 2<sup>nd</sup> leading cause of death by an infectious agent, due to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Sadly, it retains this position despite being preventable and curable (<span class="citation"><a href="#who_tuberculosis_2023">WHO 2023</a></span>).</p>

<p>Roughly 23% of the world’s population is infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, it claims 1.5 million lives each year (<span class="citation"><a href="#cdc_tuberculosis_2020">CDC 2020</a></span>).</p>

<h2 id="alan-l-hart">Alan L. Hart</h2>

<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>Hart graduated from Albany College in 1912, and in 1917 obtained a doctor of medicine degree from the University of Oregon Medical Department in Portland (now Oregon Health &amp; Science University);
[…]
Hart devoted much of his career to research into and treatment of tuberculosis. In the early 20th century the disease was the biggest killer in America. … Hart was among the first physicians to document how it then spread, via the circulatory system, causing lesions on the kidneys, spine, and brain, eventually resulting in death
[…]
In the early twentieth century [X-Rays] were used to detect bone fractures and tumors, but Hart became interested in their potential for detecting tuberculosis. Since the disease often presented no symptoms in its early stages, x-ray screening was invaluable for early detection.</p>

  <p>In 1937 Hart was hired by the Idaho Tuberculosis Association and later became the state’s Tuberculosis Control Officer. He established up Idaho’s first fixed-location and mobile TB screening clinics and spearheaded the state’s war against tuberculosis. Between 1933 and 1945 Hart traveled extensively through rural Idaho, covering thousands of miles while lecturing, conducting mass TB screenings, training new staff, and treating the effects of the epidemic.</p>

  <p>An experienced and accessible writer, Hart wrote widely for medical journals and popular publications, describing TB for technical and general audiences and giving advice on its prevention, detection, and cure. At the time the word “tuberculosis” carried a social stigma akin to venereal disease, so Hart insisted his clinics be referred to as “chest clinics”, himself as a “chest doctor”, and his patients as “chest patients”. Discretion and compassion were important tools in treating the stigmatised disease.</p>

  <p>In 1943 Hart, now recognised as preeminent in the field of tubercular Roentgenology, compiled his extensive evidence on TB and other x-ray-detectable cases into a definitive compendium, <em>These Mysterious Rays: A Nontechnical Discussion of the Uses of X-rays and Radium, Chiefly in Medicine</em> (pub. Harper &amp; Brothers), still a standard text today. The book was translated into several languages, including Spanish.</p>

<h1 id="new-galaxy-training-genome-wide-alternative-splicing-analysis">New Galaxy training: Genome-wide alternative splicing analysis</h1>

<p>Isoform switching is a biological phenomenon that plays a crucial role in the regulation and diversity of gene expression. It refers to the process by which alternative splicing of pre-mRNA generates different mRNA isoforms that can produce distinct protein products under different conditions. Despite the fact that alternative splicing has been demonstrated to play a fundamental roles in a wide range of biological contexts, such as tissue-specific expression, disease development and evolutionary adaptation, isoform-based expression anaysis pipelines are still rare when compared with gene-level quantification studies.</p>

<p>This new Galaxy training explores the isoform switching concept and provides a step-by-step guide for analyzing this regulatory mechanism. It makes use of <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR.html">IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR</a>, a R package which integrates a multi-step analysis for isoform detection and functional prediction.</p>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%; margin:auto;"><img src="/training-material/news/images/isoform_usage_post.jpg" alt="Overview of computational pipeline for isoform detection and functional prediction." width="1071" height="779" loading="lazy" /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> Adapted from Vitting-Seerup et Sandelin, 2017.</figcaption></figure>

<p>A second important aspect of this pipeline is that it allows to evaluate alternative splicing at two different levels: gene-specific and genome-wide scale. This dual-approach allows not only to indentify specific genes, but also prividing an analytical instrument for the study of genome-wide regulatory networks. Finally, a third important element of this training, directly derived from the operational capabilities of IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR, is that it allows to integrate multiple layers of information in the analysis. Concretely, in order to evaluate the functional consequences of the isoform switching events, IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR allows to integrate information bout coding-potential, protein-domains, signal peptides and instrinsically disordered regions.</p>]]></content><author><name>Cristóbal Gallardo</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new tutorial" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The GTN hosts a new training for analyzing alternative splicing at genome-wide scale!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/images/isoform_usage_post.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/images/isoform_usage_post.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">BY-COVID and RO-Crate collaboration brings new topic: FAIR Data, Workflows &amp;amp; More</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/05/11/ro-crate.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="BY-COVID and RO-Crate collaboration brings new topic: FAIR Data, Workflows &amp;amp; More" /><published>2023-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/05/11/ro-crate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/05/11/ro-crate.html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of the BY-COVID project, the RO-Crate team and BY-COVID members have
brought several RO-Crate related tutorials into the Galaxy Training Network, under a brand new Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable (FAIR) topic!</p>

<p>So we have built a similar service for the GTN:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You write a URL like <a href="https://my.galaxy.training/?path=/workflows/list">https://my.galaxy.training/?path=/workflows/list</a></li>
  <li>A user visits this URL</li>
  <li>They’re asked for which Galaxy server is their ‘home’ server</li>
  <li>They will be redirected to that path, on that server, e.g. https://usegalaxy.eu/workflows/list</li>
</ol>

<p>We will be using this to implement a ‘button’ that users can click to directly import a workflow on their home server, and as a fallback for the “Click to Run” tools enabled by Tutorial Mode.</p>

<p>Additionally there is a <a href="https://my.gat.galaxy.training">my.gat.galaxy.training</a> which provides the same service for the Galaxy Admin Training workshop series. There we will use this feature to link admins directly to the VM they are working on when they’re working through the training and we need them to e.g. see something in their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/admin</code> page or in their tool data tables.</p>

<h2 id="potential-uses">Potential Uses</h2>

<p>Regardless of which server a user will use, in the cloud or locally, you can now link to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tools</li>
  <li>Galaxy UI pages:
    <ul>
      <li>Workflow editor</li>
      <li>Workflow import</li>
      <li>TRS import</li>
      <li>Visualisations</li>
      <li>etc!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="try-them-out">Try them out</h2>

<p>Both of these services can be used from today onwards!</p>

Learning pathways are sets of tutorials curated for you by community experts to form a coherent set of lessons around a topic, building up knowledge step by step.</p>

<p>Learning paths can be accessed from the top menu bar in the GTN (or jump directly to the <a href="/training-material/learning-pathways/">learning pathways page</a> now). Check back here often as we add more learning pathways over time!</p>

<p>Teaching with Galaxy? Learning pathways are an ideal starting point to build the program for your training event!</p>

<p>Want to add your own learning pathway? Check out this <a href="/training-material/topics/contributing/faqs/learning-pathways.html">FAQ</a> for instructions. We very much welcome and encourage contributions of learning pathways!</p>

There have been a handful of attempts at this in the past, both in <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-maps">galaxyproject/galaxy-maps</a> and in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1r8LJy6la-JeIrg23aZjpwVNjJDE">a Google Map</a> on the GTN homepage.</p>

<p>We will now store this data within the GTN itself, and trainers can manage this data themselves. If you are a trainer that offers training courses in your local area, or are interested in helping others teach in that region, please feel free to update your Contributors profile with the new metadata:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">hexylena</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Helena Rasche</span>
    <span class="na">orcid</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">0000-0001-9760-8992</span>
    <span class="s">...</span>
    <span class="na">contact_for_training</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
    <span class="na">location</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="na">country</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">NL</span>
      <span class="na">lat</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">51.91</span>
      <span class="na">lon</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">4.46</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we’ll add a nice map to the GTN, and potentially the Galaxy Hub as well! The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contact_for_training</code> field is a true or false value which lets you indicate you’re open to being contacted regarding giving training. Other trainers in your region might use this if they’re looking for help giving a course or want experts in a field for a course they plan to host. We do not have plans currently expose this to “end users” looking for training, we will probably attempt to push them first to the existing events list.</p>
