<p>The evolution of techniques in the last decades has made possible the development of methods to quickly identify responsible pathogen using their <strong>DNA and without prior isolation</strong>. Long-read sequencing tehcniques like ONT make these methods even <strong>easier and more practical to identify strains quicker and with fewer reads</strong>.</p>

  <li><strong>agnostically detect pathogens</strong> (what exactly is this pathogen and what is the degree of its severity (its virulence factors) from data extracted directly (without prior cultivation) from a potentially contaminated sample (e.g. food like chicken, cow, etc.,) and sequenced using Nanopore</li>
  <li><strong>compare different samples to track</strong> the possible source of contamination</li>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>There is an ongoing explosion of scientific datasets being generated, brought on by recent technological advances in many areas of the natural sciences. As a result, the life sciences have become increasingly computational in nature, and bioinformatics has taken on a central role in research studies. However, basic computational skills, data analysis, and stewardship are still rarely taught in life science educational programs, resulting in a skills gap in many of the researchers tasked with analysing these big datasets.</p>

<p>In order to address this skills gap and empower researchers to perform their own data analyses, the Galaxy Training Network (GTN) has previously developed the Galaxy Training Platform (<a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org">https://training.galaxyproject.org</a>), an open access, community-driven framework for the collection of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) training materials for data analysis utilizing the user-friendly Galaxy framework as its primary data analysis platform.</p>

<p>Since its inception, this training platform has thrived, with the number of tutorials and contributors growing rapidly, and the range of topics extending beyond life sciences to include topics such as climatology, cheminformatics, and machine learning. While initially aimed at supporting researchers directly, the GTN framework has proven to be an invaluable resource for educators as well. We have focused our efforts in recent years on adding increased support for this growing community of instructors. New features have been added to facilitate the use of the materials in a classroom setting, simplifying the contribution flow for new materials, and have added a set of train-the-trainer lessons. Here, we present the latest developments in the GTN project, aimed at facilitating the use of the Galaxy Training materials by educators, and its usage in different learning environments.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="paper" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our new paper about the Galaxy Training Network has been published this week in Plos Computational Biology: “Galaxy Training: A powerful framework for teaching!”]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New Tutorial Suite: Deconvolution with MuSiC, from public data to disease interrogation!</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2022/11/29/deconvolution.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New Tutorial Suite: Deconvolution with MuSiC, from public data to disease interrogation!" /><published>2022-11-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2022/11/29/deconvolution</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2022/11/29/deconvolution.html"><![CDATA[<p>The still new and shiny single-cell analysis topic now boasts a <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/index.html">deconvolution tutorial suite</a>! What does deconvolution do you ask? Well, in this context, it infers cell proportions from bulk RNA-seq data. You heard that correctly - instead of expensive new single-cell experiments, you can re-analyse old bulk RNA-seq data and estimate cell proportions. All you need is a reasonably good single cell dataset to use as a reference and you’re good to go! The tutorial suite shows you how to build your reference from publicly available single cell data, and apply analysis to some publicly available bulk RNA-seq data.</p>
