<p>So we have built a similar service for the GTN:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You write a URL like <a href="https://my.galaxy.training/?path=/workflows/list">https://my.galaxy.training/?path=/workflows/list</a></li>
  <li>A user visits this URL</li>
  <li>They’re asked for which Galaxy server is their ‘home’ server</li>
  <li>They will be redirected to that path, on that server, e.g. https://usegalaxy.eu/workflows/list</li>
</ol>

<p>We will be using this to implement a ‘button’ that users can click to directly import a workflow on their home server, and as a fallback for the “Click to Run” tools enabled by Tutorial Mode.</p>

<p>Additionally there is a <a href="https://my.gat.galaxy.training">my.gat.galaxy.training</a> which provides the same service for the Galaxy Admin Training workshop series. There we will use this feature to link admins directly to the VM they are working on when they’re working through the training and we need them to e.g. see something in their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/admin</code> page or in their tool data tables.</p>

<h2 id="potential-uses">Potential Uses</h2>

<p>Regardless of which server a user will use, in the cloud or locally, you can now link to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tools</li>
  <li>Galaxy UI pages:
    <ul>
      <li>Workflow editor</li>
      <li>Workflow import</li>
      <li>TRS import</li>
      <li>Visualisations</li>
      <li>etc!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="try-them-out">Try them out</h2>

<p>Both of these services can be used from today onwards!</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-them">How do I use them?</h2>

<p>The PURLs are in the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gxy.io/GTN:[id]</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[id]</code> is the identifier of the tutorial, slide, or FAQ. For example, the identifier for the <a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/ansible-galaxy/tutorial.html">Galaxy Installation with Ansible</a> tutorial is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GTN:T00001</code>. The PURL for this tutorial is thus <a href="https://gxy.io/GTN:T00001">gxy.io/GTN:T00001</a>.

<p>We will now store this data within the GTN itself, and trainers can manage this data themselves. If you are a trainer that offers training courses in your local area, or are interested in helping others teach in that region, please feel free to update your Contributors profile with the new metadata:</p>

<p>And we’ll add a nice map to the GTN, and potentially the Galaxy Hub as well! The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contact_for_training</code> field is a true or false value which lets you indicate you’re open to being contacted regarding giving training. Other trainers in your region might use this if they’re looking for help giving a course or want experts in a field for a course they plan to host.

This year we want to celebrate that by introducing a new theme (<a href="#" onclick="setTheme('blm')">Click to Activate</a>), and taking a look at one of the most famous Black figures in Science: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks">Henrietta Lacks</a> whose contribution to science went unremarked and unappreciated for decades while white scientists took credit for advancements built on her cell line.</p>

<p>Her cell line is the oldest and most commonly used human cell line <span class="citation"><a href="#Rahbari_2009">Rahbari <i>et al.</i> 2009</a></span>, and is the reason for large scale policy change, especially major regulatory changes in informed consent in the United States <span class="citation"><a href="#Beskow_2016">Beskow 2016</a></span>. Unfortunately none of these changes happened quickly, it took until 2013 before her descendants could have a say in how her genetic material is used in NIH research <span class="citation"><a href="#lacks_family_2013">University 2013</a></span>.</p>

<h2 id="johns-hopkins">Johns Hopkins</h2>

<p>Henrietta was a patient at Johns Hopkins Hospital; Johns Hopkins University employs many of the core Galaxy Developers.</p>

<p>Johns Hopkins has announced the construction of a new building named in her honor, specifically focusing on research around bioethics: “The building will support the Berman Institute of Bioethics, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and additional departments, as well as collaborative space for education, research, and meetings.” <span class="citation"><a href="#jhu_construction_announcement">University 2022</a></span></p>

<h2 id="bioethics">Bioethics</h2>

<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>Lacks’s case is one of many examples of the lack of informed consent in 20th century medicine. Communication between tissue donors and doctors was virtually nonexistent (i.e. cells were taken without patient consent, nor were they told what the cells would be used for). Johns Hopkins Hospital, where Lacks received treatment and had her tissue harvested, was the only hospital in the Baltimore area where African American patients could receive free care. The patients receiving free care from this segregated sect of the hospital often became research subjects without their knowledge. Lacks’s family also had no access to her patient files and had no say in who received HeLa cells or what they would be used for. Additionally, as HeLa cells were popularized and used more frequently throughout the scientific community, Lacks’s relatives received no financial benefit and continued to live with limited access to healthcare. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa#Controversy">via Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We recommend the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immortal_Life_of_Henrietta_Lacks">“The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks”</a> for further reading on the topic.</p>

<h2 id="gtn-connection">GTN Connection</h2>

<p>The GTN has four tutorials that make use of HeLa cell line data. After reading about Henrietta and her impact on science, you might be interested in following one of these tutorials to learn about the applications of her cells, two on imaging analysis:</p>
